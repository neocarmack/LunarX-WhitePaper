# LunarX WhitePaper - World Wide Table for Data Driven Decentralized Applications

>LunarX is a World Wide distributed Table, designed for building a decentralized, economic, temper proof, anonymous and autonomous data management infrastructure for decentralized applications(DApp) and their users. 

It resembles database systems, but without centralized servers.
Every peer joining the LunarX network becomes a part of the whole data service system, providing data access functionality to clients.

In real world businesses, not all the data is transactional that has to be put into a blockchain, but these great amount of data still requires properties of anonymous, autonomous, temper proof, scalability and traceability, in an untrusted peer to peer network.

Some of these data is structured, other is unstructured. We propose an algebraic definition of commutative map to study these data structures within a uniform framework, and to see when given a data structure, which kind of encryption schemes are commutative with it, and how to construct a possible scheme.
Built upon several key distributed computation, cryptography and database techniques, LunarX is designed for serving such data management purpose.

It is a developing pilot project, hoping to contribute some ideas to the community.
