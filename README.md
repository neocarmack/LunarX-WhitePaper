# LunarX-WhitePaper

LunarX is a World Wide distributed Table, designed for managing structured and unstructured data generated by decentralized applications(DApp).

It resembles database systems, but without centralized servers. Every peer joining the LunarX network becomes a part of the whole data service system, providing data access functionality to clients. In real world businesses, not all the data is transactional that has to be put in a blockchain, but these data still requires properties of anonymous, autonomous, temper proof, scalability and traceability, in an untrusted peer to peer network. 

Some of these data is structured, other is unstructured. We define the concept of commutative map to study these data structures within a uniform framework, and to see when given a data structure, which kind of encryption schemes are commutative with it, and how to construct a possible scheme. Built upon several key distributed computation, cryptography and database techniques, LunarX is designed for serving such data management purpose.

It is a developing pilot project, hoping to contribute some ideas to the community.
