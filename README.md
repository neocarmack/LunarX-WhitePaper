# LunarX WhitePaper - World Wide Table for Data Driven Decentralized Applications

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/White--Paper-v0.6.0-green.svg)

>LunarX is a World Wide distributed Table, designed for building a decentralized, economic, temper proof, anonymous and autonomous data management infrastructure for decentralized applications(DApp) and their users. 

>It resembles database systems, but without centralized servers.
Every peer joining the LunarX network becomes a part of the whole data service system, providing data access functionality to clients.

>In real world businesses, not all the data is transactional that has to be put into a blockchain, but these great amount of data still requires properties of anonymous, autonomous, temper proof, scalability and traceability, in an untrusted peer to peer network.

>Some of these data is structured, other is unstructured. We propose an algebraic definition of commutative map to study these data structures within a uniform framework, and to see when given a data structure, which kind of encryption schemes are commutative with it, and how to construct a possible scheme.
Built upon several key distributed computation, cryptography and database techniques, LunarX is designed for serving such data management purpose.

>It is a developing pilot project, hoping to contribute some ideas to the community.
